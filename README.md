# Blockchain Commons Deployment Scripts

<!--Guidelines: https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/secure-template/wiki -->

### _by Nicholas Ochiel_

**Deployment Scripts** contains scripts used to run blockchain services at Blockchain Commons.

## List of files
- `/etc/nagios4`: Configuration for nagios4 monitoring. 
  - Nagios configuration reference can be found here: https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/4/en/toc.html.

### Also See

Also see our standard Bitcoin setup with [Bitcoin Standup Scripts](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-Standup-Scripts).

## Installation Instructions

- [Install Linode's LongView](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/monitor-and-configure-nagios-alerts-on-debian-10-ubuntu-2004/#install-email-services)
- [Install Nagios on Linode](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/tools/monitoring/developers/)
- [Install Tor](https://support.torproject.org/apt/#apt_tor-deb-repo)

## Usage Instructions

**NB: Do not commit any credentials to this repository.** Any credentials/keys should be configured as `$USER` variables in etc\nagios4\resource.cfg. We use the following:
- `$USER2`: Tor proxy port.
- `$USER3`: Username for BlockckainCommons Bitcoin RPC.
- `$USER4`: RPC auth password generated using https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/share/rpcauth/rpcauth.py.

### Nagios 
- Define hosts to be monitored in: etc\nagios4\servers\servers.cfg
#### Nagios email notifications
- List contact details in etc\nagios4\objects\contacts.cfg.
- There are several alternative setups for email notifications:
    - [Using Gmail](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/configure-postfix-to-send-mail-using-gmail-and-google-workspace-on-debian-or-ubuntu/)
    - [Using external SMTP](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/postfix-smtp-debian7/)
    - [Run a Linode mail-server on a subdomain](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/running-a-mail-server/#sending-email-on-linode)
    - Modify any `notify-host-by-email` `command` directives in `etc/nagios4/commands.cfg` to use the settings you have configured for sending email.

#### Nagios monitoring of Tor services
- The hostname for a Tor hidden service is read using: `cat /var/lib/tor/$HOSTNAME/hostname`
- Modify any `service.check_command` directives to use the `check_http! -p $USER2` to monitor hidden services.
    - `$USER2` is a variable configured in etc\nagios4\resource.cfg.

## Responsible Disclosure

We want to keep all of our software safe for everyone. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner. We are unfortunately not able to offer bug bounties at this time.

We do ask that you offer us good faith and use best efforts not to leak information or harm any user, their data, or our developer community. Please give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before you publish it. Do not defraud our users or us in the process of discovery. We promise not to bring legal action against researchers who point out a problem provided they do their best to follow the these guidelines.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities in private via email to ChristopherA@BlockchainCommons.com (do not use this email for support). Please do NOT create publicly viewable issues for suspected security vulnerabilities.

The following keys may be used to communicate sensitive information to developers:

| Name              | Fingerprint                                        |

You can import a key by running the following command with that individualâ€™s fingerprint: `gpg --recv-keys "<fingerprint>"` Ensure that you put quotes around fingerprints that contain spaces.
